  Alternative example for context:

  - Imagine you are watching TV and have muted it for the commercials.
    The first commercial you see shows a kitchen knife setting on a cutting board on the counter.
    Around it there are lots of different kinds of vegetables and a stock pot.
    Given that context, you would likely assume they were advertising a cooking show.
  - The next commercial starts. You see the same kitchen knife. This time it is in the trunk
    (boot) of car along with some rope, duct tape, a tarp and a shovel.  That context brings
    up a completely different kind of show! Even though the kitchen knife is exactly the same.
